####Some assumptions
* Demo running on [Heroku](https://powerful-citadel-2869.herokuapp.com/).
* Let's keep the demo simple, there is no auth or concept of users, and everything, including the API, is fully public.
* In "real life", I would probably use something like [Claudio's clone of Bitly](https://github.com/jcfigueiredo/python-bitly). However in this case it was fun to try to implement the shortener myself.
* This is, as always, still a work in progress, and your feedback and suggestions are [very welcome](https://github.com/gterzian/payperks_demo/issues/5).
