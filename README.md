###PayPerks Url Shortener

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gterzian/payperks_demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gterzian/payperks_demo)

####Some notes
* Demo running on [Heroku](https://powerful-citadel-2869.herokuapp.com/).
* Let's keep the demo simple, there is no auth or concept of users, and everything, including [the API](https://powerful-citadel-2869.herokuapp.com/api/), is fully public.
* In "real life", I would probably use something like [Claudio's clone of Bitly](https://github.com/jcfigueiredo/python-bitly). However in this case it was fun to try to implement the shortener myself.
* This is, as always, still a work in progress, and your feedback and suggestions are [very welcome](https://github.com/gterzian/payperks_demo/issues/5). 
* The "Copy" button doesn't seem to work on mobile.
